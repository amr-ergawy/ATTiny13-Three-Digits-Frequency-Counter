# ATTiny13-Frequency-Counter
This is a frequency counter application of my ATTiny13 board and driver of a 3-digits LED display. It can be further extended as a speed meter or similar application. The system is tested against my ATMega32 8-levels logic pulser and a commercial logic analyzer. For more details, see the project website.
