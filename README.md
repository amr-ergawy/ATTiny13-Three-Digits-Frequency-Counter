# ATTiny13-Frequency-Counter
This is a frequency counter application of my ATTiny13 board and driver of a 3-digits LED display. It can be further extended as a speed meter or similar application.

The system is tested against my ATMega32 8-levels logic pulser and a commercial logic analyzer. For more details, see the project website. You can watch a video of this three parties test on the project website https://sites.google.com/site/aergawyprojects/microcontroller-projects/attiny13-based-frequency-counter

On this repository, you can find the project source code and a PDF with the hardware diagram of the board.
